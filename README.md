### [🍄 Game of life in a React old fashion way](https://github.com/deljdlx/dc-gameoflife)

A [Conway game of life implemention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) implementation written in **(very) old-school React**, straight from the **prehistoric era of front-end development** (circa 2013).  

🦖 Featuring:
- `React.createElement(...)` – because hooks weren’t even a thing back then!  
- Inline styles like it’s **CSS apocalypse**  
- `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` – living on the edge!

👓 Demo: [https://gameoflife.jlb.ninja/](https://gameoflife.jlb.ninja/)

### [🧊 Display block](https://github.com/deljdlx/dc-displayblock)

🚀 A **3D "voxel" rendering engine**, built **entirely from scratch** using **only JavaScript, CSS, and HTML**.  

It’s **a voxel engine that refuses to acknowledge that it shouldn't exist** 😆.
